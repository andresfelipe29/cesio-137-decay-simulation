This project showcases a simulation of the decay process of Cesium-137 using an exponencial and a binomial model.

#Simulation

In order to run the simulation, it is first necessary to run the programs "exp-decay.py" and "bin-decay.py", they generate the .txt files containing the data with wich the histograms are built.

#Graphics

"graficos.py" colects all the data and creates the graphs for all N-nuclei specified in "setup.txt".

"requirements.txt" lists all the libraries needed to run the codes.
