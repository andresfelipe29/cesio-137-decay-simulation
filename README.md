This project showcases a simulation of the decay process of Cesium-137 using an exponencial and a binomial model. All the results are shown in the paper "Resultados, informe de simulaci√≥n sobre el decaimiento del cesio 137"

"requirements.txt" lists all the libraries needed to run the codes.

# Simulation

In order to run the simulation, it is first necessary to run the programs "exp-decay.py" and "bin-decay.py", they generate the .txt files in "datos" containing the data with wich the histograms are built.

# Graphics

"graficos.py" colects all the data and creates the graphs for all N-nuclei specified in "setup.txt", the graphs are then saved to "graficos"
